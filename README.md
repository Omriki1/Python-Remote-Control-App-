A remote control It tool that lets people control your pc using python only with sockets!
I made this for my final's year project in my program engineering class of my school and it is worth 70% of my grade in the "Bagrot" of program engineering in israel - 3 units for the "Bagrot".
lso added my project documentation that I submitted to my school for anyone to look at it. It contains pictures of my project, explanations and code references, it might not be up to date but it contains most of my work. For reading my code I recommend just reading the git files
